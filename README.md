# Modexpowering3
a 2048 bit RSA verilog project basing on Montgomery , Karatsuba multiplier
@ fate studio @ Brent Kung @Karatsuba

As to the adder module, booth-wallace seems to be a more acceptable choice, but when it does not perform well in this project
The max frequency is 222.32Mhz under 100Mhz clk, however the counter SCA measures are taken seldom consideration, which is the basic poweringladder montgomery.
The gray coding for finite state machine is very useful for decreasing the power. A more powerful and safer RSA project is coming during 2020.9-12.
